# RATS UNITED HOME UPDATE LOG
this is displayed on a board in HOME using some funky http stuff I made here's a brief rundown on how it works<br>


to avoid the most lag on the server as possible they're split into groups as folders (I would do groups of 5 but up to you)<br>
each group should be numbered as the number will decide what order it displays<br>
it should also have the word "log" in the name it's not case specific though so go off<br>

names can be anything usually as long as you number them correctly

ex: 
- 1_cool updates
- cool update 1
- 1
- upd1

inside of that folder there should be your actual logs as markdown (.md) files<br>
the files inside follow the same rules as groups except they don't require the word log<br>

ex: 
- cool update log 1.md
- cool update log v1.md
- 1_cool update
